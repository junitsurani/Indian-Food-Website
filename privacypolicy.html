<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>GDPR Provides Rights for individuals<br>
    The right to be informed</b><br>
    Please read the Privacy notice.</p>

<br>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The right of access</b><br>


GDPR gives people the right to receive a copy of any personal information a company holds on them. If an individual requests for their data, the requests will be dealt without delay and within one month, unless the request is particularly complex in which case a further two months may be allowed.
<br><br>

<b>The right of rectification & the right to erasure</b><br>


GDPR gives people the right to have their personal data erased or amend the data without undue delay.<br><br>


<b>The right to restrict processing</b><br>


GDPR gives people the right to ‘block’ or suppress the processing of their personal data if, for example, they are disputing its accuracy.<br><br>


<b>The right to data portability</b><br>


GDPR gives people the right to obtain their personal data in a format that will enable them to move, copy or transfer their information from one IT system to another.<br><br>


<b>The right to object</b><br>

GDPR gives people a right to object to certain types of processing such as for direct marketing purposes. This means that if someone receives material via e-mail, post or text, they can contact the company that sends out the material and ask them to stop, which the company must do immediately free of charge.<br><br>


<b>Automated decision-making</b><br>

GDPR gives people the right not be subject to an automated decision-making process where those decisions have “a legal effect” or “a similar, significant effect” on them. However, this right does not apply if an automated decision is necessary for entering into a contract between the company and the individual, is authorised by law or was based on explicit consent.<br><br></p>


<p style="text-align:justify;">GDPR has identified eight specific rights for individuals that must be complied with by companies. This gives people the right to:<br>

    -have their personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete<br>

        <b>GDPR Policy</b><br>
        
        Website privacy notice<br>
        Privacy Notice<br>
        This is the privacy notice of AceFoods. In this document, "we", "our", or "us" refer to Acefoods.
        <br><br><b>Introduction</b><br>
        
        This privacy notice aims to inform you about how we collect and process any information that we collect
         from you, or that you provide to us. It covers information that could identify you (“personal information
         ”) and information that could not. In the context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, 
         store, transfer, use or otherwise act on information. It tells you about your privacy rights and how the
          law protects you. We are committed to protecting your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal
           information. Our policy is not just an exercise in complying with the law, but a continuation of our
            respect for you and your personal information. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all 
            information you provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate. Our policy complies with UK law 
            accordingly implemented, including that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
             The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our obligations to you in regards to the 
             processing and control of your personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the 
             information provided at http://www.knowyourprivacyrights.org Except as set out below, we do not 
             share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any information collected through our website.</p>

             <br><br>
             <p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Data Protection Officer</b><br>
                We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for ensuring that our policy is followed. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights,<br>
                <br>
                
                <b>2. Data we process</b><br>
                We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of personal data about you. We have collated these into groups as follows: Your identity includes information such as first name, last name, title, date of birth, and other identifiers that you may have provided at some time. Your contact information includes information such as billing address, delivery address, email address, telephone numbers and any other information you have given to us for the purpose of communication or meeting. Your financial data includes information such as your bank account and payment card details.

Marketing data includes your preferences in receiving marketing from us; communication preferences; responses and actions in relation to your use of our services. We may aggregate anonymous data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose. Anonymous data is data that does not identify you as an individual. Aggregated data may be derived from your personal data but is not considered personal information in law because it does not reveal your identity. For example, we may aggregate profile data to assess interest in a product or service. However, if we combine or connect aggregated data with your personal information so that it can identify you in any way, we treat the combined data as personal information and it will be used in accordance with this privacy notice.

                Where we need to collect personal data by law, or under the terms of a contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform that contract. In that case, we may have to stop providing a service to you. If so, we will notify you of this at the time.
                <br><br>The bases on which we process information about you <br><br> The law requires us to determine under which of six defined bases we process different categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the basis for each category.

                <b>6. Information we process with your consent</b> <br>
               Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us to provide you more information about our business, including [job opportunities and] our products and services, you provide your consent to us to process information that may be personal information.

                <b>8. Information we process because we have a legal obligation</b> <br>
                Sometimes, we must process your information in order to comply with a statutory obligation.

                <b>10. Complaints regarding content on our website</b> <br>
                Our website is a publishing medium. Anyone may register and then publish information about himself, herself or some other person. We do not moderate or control what is posted. OR We attempt to moderate user generated content, but we are not always able to do so as soon as that content is published. If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall investigate your complaint. If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do so, we shall remove the content while we investigate. Free speech is a fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the content that offends you. If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall not correspond with you about it.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>11. Information relating to your method of payment</b> <br>
                First option: We store information about your debit or credit card or other means of payment when you first provide it to us. We store this payment information [at your request] in order to make repeat purchasing of goods and services easier next time you visit our website. [We also store it to help us prevent fraud.] We take the following measures to protect your payment information: • We keep your payment information encrypted on our servers. • We do not keep all your payment information so as: a) to prevent the possibility of our duplicating a transaction without a new instruction from you; b) to prevent any other third party from carrying out a transaction without your consent • Access to your payment information is restricted to authorised staff only. • If we ask you questions about your payment information, we only show [partial detail OR the first four OR the last four digits of the debit or credit card number], so that you can identify the means of payment to which we refer. • [Other...] We automatically delete your payment information [after X days OR when a credit or debit card expires]. Second option: Payment information is never taken by us or transferred to us either through our website or otherwise. Our employees and contractors never have access to it. At the point of payment, you are transferred to a secure page on the website of [WorldPay / SagePay / PayPal / MoneyBookers / Stripe] or some other reputable payment service provider. That page may be branded to look like a page on our website, but it is not controlled by us.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>12. Information about your direct debit</b> <br>
                When you agree to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information you give to us is passed to our own bank [name of bank] for processing according to our instructions. We [do / do not] keep a copy. [We keep this information only for the duration of the direct debit arrangement.] We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.
                <br><br>
                
                
                <b>13. Job application and employment</b> <br>
                If you send us information in connection with a job application, we may keep it for up to [three years] in case we decide to contact you at a later date.

                <b>15 Complaining</b> <br>
                When we receive a complaint, we record all the information you have given to us. We use that information to resolve your complaint. If your complaint reasonably requires us to contact some other person, we may decide to give to that other person some of the information contained in your complaint. We do this as infrequently as possible, but it is a matter for our sole discretion as to whether we do give information, and if we do, what that information is. We may also compile statistics showing information obtained from this source to assess the level of service we provide, but not in a way that could identify you or any other person.

                <b>22 Credit reference</b><br>
                To assist in combating fraud, we share information with credit reference agencies, so far as it relates to clients or customers who instruct their credit card issuer to cancel payment to us without having first provided an acceptable reason to us and given us the opportunity to refund their money.

                <b>23 Data may be processed outside the European Union</b><br>
                
                Our websites are hosted in [country]. We may also use outsourced services in countries outside the European Union from time to time in other aspects of our business. Accordingly data obtained within the UK or any other country could be processed outside the European Union. For example, some of the software our website uses may have been developed in the United States of America or in Australia. We use the following safeguards with respect to data transferred outside the European Union: • the processor is within the same corporate group as our business or organisation and abides by the same binding corporate rules regarding data processing. • the data protection clauses in our contracts with data processors include transfer clauses written by or approved by a supervisory authority in the European Union [, specifically that in the country of …] • we comply with a code of conduct approved by a supervisory authority in the European Union [, specifically that in the country of …] • we are certified under an approved certification mechanism as provided for in the GDPR • both our organisation and the processor are public authorities between whom there is either a legally binding agreement or administrative arrangements approved by a supervisory authority in the European Union relating to protection of your information

                <b>24. Your duty to inform us of changes</b><br>
                It is important that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal data changes.

                <b>27. Verification of your information</b><br>
                When we receive any request to access, edit or delete personal identifiable information we shall first take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or otherwise taking any action. This is important to safeguard your information.

                <b>28 Use of site by children</b><br>
                Under UK law, you cannot form a contract with a child. So a child cannot agree to your terms and conditions, which means that he or she cannot agree to your terms regarding use of his or her information. Additionally, only a parent or guardian can give consent. So it is very difficult to have a lawful basis for processing personal information about children. Additionally, personal information about children is regarded as more sensitive than the same information about an adult. The consequences for data breaches could be much greater. We suggest you edit this paragraph to suit your website and keep it in.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>29 Encryption of data sent between us</b><br>
                This paragraph is included to reassure visitors. If you do not use SSL then remove the paragraph.
                <br><br>
                
                <b>30 How you can complain</b><br>
                This paragraph sets out standard wording that tells visitors how to make a complaint. It gives you a stronger argument to use arbitration or mediation as a means of resolving a complaint, rather than going to court. In any case, you must tell visitors to your site about their right to complain to the supervisory body, the Information Commissioner’s Office.

                <b>31 Retention period for personal data</b><br>
                Basic UK law relating to limitation for bringing a claim, contract matters, tax and other areas often requires data to be retained for six years. You will be “safe” if you specify that period for commercial transactions.</p>
